# Face the Music

**Real-time facial recognition using a Python backend to pull music based on a user's emotions from Spotify in real-time.**

## Usage

## Background

Current facial recognition technology has progressed to the point that it can be done in nearly real-time. In this project, I use the Python library [DeepFace](https://pypi.org/project/deepface/) to read peoples' emotions in real-time, and then the Spotify [Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/) and [Web Playback SDK](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/reference/) to play music related to those emotions.

### Technical Specifications



## Upcoming Plans
  - [x] Build working local prototype in Python
  - [ ] Make portable -- port to browser?
    - [ ] Learn React
  - [ ] Make portable to Raspberry PIs
  - [ ] Set up in MADD Center
  - [ ] Integrate with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) early recognition research
